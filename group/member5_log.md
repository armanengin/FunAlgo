On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
This week I downloaded the Android Studio and I learned how to use it properly. It was a hard process because I had never used Android in coding. Thus, I had to start learning Android Studio with basic tutorial videos. After that, I created and started to coding PlayPage with layout.

### ~ 04.05.2020~
This week, I and my group members were trying to deal with github. It seemed so basic but we could not push our jobs. Thus, we learned github first. After that, I finished PlayPage. Moreover, I coded Level 9 Page with appropriate layouts and codes.

### ~ 11.05.2020~
This week, I started to coding Instructions Page and I solved some problems on my pages.
