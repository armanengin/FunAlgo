                Group Reflection
Experience:
    We did the Project on Android Studio and we have never used it before. Therefore,
 we started to work from the beginning of android but now we can transport information from page to page.
 We can code compatible layouts and views and we can create a useful application for a specific target audience

Difficulties and Annoying Parts:
     As a group, Github was annoying because we could not
understand completely how to use Github at the beginning. For example, when we were coding and finishing some
classes, we just could not combine them but eventually, we figured it out. Also, we had some troubles with specific classes such as music page, whenever we turn on music, previous music did not close and kept playing, Yet, we solved this problem finally.

What we could do better next time:
    As we mentioned before, we had difficulties with combining pages. We have learned the Github
then we solved this problem. However, we have allocated too much time for it.
Instead of this, we could learn Github firstly. 

Time and Effort:
We think that we roughly spent 3 to 4 weeks for the project and every group member studied really hard.

What we achieved:
 We believe we achieved making an application that can be useful for children because at the beginning
 when we had not started coding, and all we had was a design report, we thought we just could make a simple and basic
 algorithm learning app as we described in the design report, However, when we finished everything, it was, then
 beyond our design. That is why we proud of what we achieved.
