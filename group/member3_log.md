On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
+ This week I started to think about our project in detail. I have downloaded android studio and met with its structure, xml files and emulators.
+ Although musics couldn't found by android studio first, eventually achieved to add musics to the raw file. Also  written the code for play and pause the musics, created the music page layout. Although constraints in the layouts a bit challengingc in the begining, in the end I understand the logic of xml layouts.
+ Me and my friend Deniz Semih Özal tried to link music, settings and theme page together with intent class. However, in some cases problems occured so we solve the problem with shared preferences(with the geting datas.)

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
+ This week was quit challenging, because we had some problems with github. We couldn't push our work firstly and also after pushed it, we had some problems about merging our works to each other as well. However, close to end of the week we understand the github.
+ I code the information button, which simply give brief information about that current level, and added it to the layouts .
+ I wrote the code for showCodeButton which gets data from the levels(with sahred preferences) and shows the user's code for that level. Then added the code ShowCodeI class and implemented the code for each level. Moreover, creted the showCodeButton and added it to each levelPage layouts.

### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
+ For achievements page I had to create a graph contains the user information. Therefore, i needed a library because android studio doesn't have it in first place. I tried some graphs such as graphview and its various verisons but all of them were problematic or I couldn't achieve to work them but spent quit a lot of time to them. Then I serached for other libraies on SONOTYPE, finally graphlib library has worked.
+ I created the AchievementsPage with the graphlib and code the graph as well as created the layout for it and linked it to other pages.
+ Added the data to the graph with shared preferences and also created a button to wipe to datas.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
+ This week i did not change anythink big in the project. Simply added more comments and javadocs.
+ Added more detailed text to the information button for level 7,8,9
+ Added shared preferences to the avatar on the achievements page

### ~ 25.05.2020 ~
+ Have written the readme2.txt with Deniz Semih Özal.
+ Tried to solve the bugs for final code(such as mute button problem).
+ Also tried to make compatible app for all phones. Though some problems are fixed for other phones, few still carry on.
