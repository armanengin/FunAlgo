On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

We did our first meeting and we have reached on consensus about what are we going to do. After meeting, I tried to learn Android Studio. So I read some documentation and watched video to learn Android Studio. After few days, I was ready to start coding my page(HomePage). I took some backgrounds and button designs from fatih and implement these into my layout.

We decided to design the game. I looked some game examples in youtube to learn how to code a game with android studio and java. And I realized that I need to dowland map editor and I searched for it. Then I dowland map editor and create some maps to put into our game. Then I discussed with fatih and took his game code. Then I looked this code and learn from it. I designed Leve1,2,8. Also I learned some terms related with github such as Merge, Fork etc.. I worked on github. At the beggining, github seems diffucult to me, but, after a short period of practise and learning I solved how to use it.

We struggled to add delay movements since at the begginning bee is going to position without any delay. And I learned how to use multithreating. To do that, I had to read Big Java Late Objects and documentation about threats. After this, I figured how to add delay our program. But, I need to change lots of code. Then me and fatih recreated the code of whole game. We extend all level pages from level1page and we shortened our code. Me and fatih had to do a lot of work to shorten code. But, after changing code, the code of the game became more neat and nice.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
I fixed some bugs in the levelPages, specificly level1,2,8. I add comments and I improved my code efficency and change same variable names.

### ~ 25.05.2020~
This week, We tried to solve the bugs as a group and finish the whole project and we try to develop our code organisation.
