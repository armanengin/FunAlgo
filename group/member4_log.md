On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 27.04.2020~
This week I have learned how to use Android Studio and XML by watching videos on Internet. Also I read some articles
to get used to Android Studio's basics.
Then, we had a group meeting to decide what we were going to do. After that, we did divison of labor and I did level
page interface.

### ~ 04.05.2020~
This week we started to make the actual game after the interfaces. Deniz and I started to do the creative part.
We first tried to learn drag and drop system in Android Studio. Then, we do research how to draw a line on Android 
Studio. It was really challenging because there were many different style to do drawing. But, at the end, we managed
to solve the problem and draw lines on Emulator. However, there is a still a problem about animation part and we have
not solved it yet. The problem is that we could not animate lines we drew but we are doing research about it.

solved the problem but we hope we will solve it.
