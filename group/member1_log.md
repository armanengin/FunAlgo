On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week we did the first division of labor after the group meeting, and everyone played a different role in the project. I got the task of making the First Page. But at first I didn't know how to use Android stuido, so by doing research on the Internet, I first learned how to use android studio and design in android studio. Then I found some backgrounds and customized them. After designing the background, I made some button designs and added functionality to these buttons. In addition I designed the logo of our application. While designing the first page, the layout section was very challenging for me because the buttons and icons that I put were in different places when I started the application. To solve this problem, I watched some layout videos from the internet. Finally I designed and coded the First Page.

This week we decided to design the game after the group meeting. First I watched the video and learned how to design a game map and downloaded the necessary program for this. After downloading the program, I watched some videos on the internet and learned how to use this program. Then I designed level 3 and wrote the codes. Then I designed level 4, level 5, level 6 and level 7 and changed the codes according to the level content. After writing the codes of the levels, I searched the internet and learned how to save the data to the system. I used the SharedPreferences class using the information I learned from the internet and added new codes to the First Page and level pages. In addition, this week we had some problems about github. Therefore, I did some research on the Internet to learn how I can use github more efficiently and how I can pull and push a project.

This week I added the star counts feature to improve the functionality of the levels. The user will gain stars depending on the number of moves. Therefore, I made a section showing the number of movements of the user. Each time the user selects an activity, the number of moves increases by 1. The user can learn the number of movements by looking at this section. The number of stars won by the user will be saved in the system and this data will be sent to the achievements page. In addition, I designed and coded a finishing screen that occurs when the user finishes the game. In this screen, the user can see the number of stars he has had and play the level again. Besides I designed and coded the splashScreen page, which is the landing page of our project. Because the code is a bit irregular and inefficient we also used the class hierarchy with Alperen, and we made the code more regular and efficient.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
This week I added comments to the First page, Level 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 classes and made the code more understandable and organized. I also created new button and layout designs on the internet to make the button and layout views on the Level pages more attractive. Then I applied these designs to the buttons and layouts on the level pages. I applied the same designs to the background of the splash screen page. In addition, since our application is an application running in a horizontal position, the application was broken when the user used the phone in the vertical position. Therefore, I did some research on the Internet to edit the application orientation. Then I prevented the phone from turning automatically using a method I learned on the internet.

### ~ 25.05.2020 ~
This week I tried to solve some mistakes in the project. I did some research on the internet to make the project a file with APK extension with Alperen and finally, we did it. I have completed some shortcomings and added comments to some classes for the Final Code.
