On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 27.04.2020 ~
+ I have downloaded the Android Studio and I have watched many videos regarding Android and XML files. I have tried to learn the logic behind the activities in Android. The emulator part was difficult as well and I have tried to learn what gradle means and why it is useful for our purposes. 
+ Firstly, I have created the Theme Page. Although the Theme Page layout looks proper in XML file, it did not fit into emulator and it was constantly slipping. Then I have realised the reason of this, it was related to Constraint Layout and its implementations. I have solved that problem. Then I have added some features to the theme ( i.e clicking the button and theme changes, volume button etc.)
+ I have added Settings Page. In this part, the main problem was not the layout. I have to learn how to store data and how to share it because when I have changed the theme in Theme Page, the background information goes to Setting Page. However, when going back to the Theme Page, the background have turned to white. So, me and my friend Arman have tried to fix that and we have realised that using Shared Preferences was very effective instead of using Intent. And also we have merged our files ( i.e Music, Theme, Settings).

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
+ This week was very annoying because of GitHub. We have lost so much time because of trying to merge, pull, push and so on. We have tried to  learn the basis of GitHub and finally we have understood by the end of the week.
+ In this week, me and my friend Remzi have started to do the Creative Mode. Firstly, I had to learn how to do drop and drag, draw a line using canvas, and create a new button when adding the dragging the button. In this part, the most difficult thing was that creating a line in the view according to user's inputs. Therefore, we had to change our Line View class and we have tried to create bitmap and implementing canvas on it. Fortunately, we have managed to do it successfully.

 ### ~ 11.05.2020 ~
+ In this week, we have tried to add pencil animation which follows to the line. Although I have tried to animation pencil, it cannot follow the line properly. Also, we have tried to add Thread to draw line by line in time, but unfortunately it does not work as well.

### ~ 18.05.2020 ~
+ In this week, we finally manage to solve the animation of shapes and it works properly. 
+ I have changed layout a little bit, I have changed the button colors and so on. Also, I have added some comments.
### ~ 25.05.2020~
+ This week, I have tried to add some comments and fix some bugs.
+ Me and arman have written the readme2.txt
